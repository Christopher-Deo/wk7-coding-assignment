        <center><h3>Origins of a City</h3></center>
    <p>The origins of Kansas City date to the early 1800s, when French fur traders arrived by the Missouri River and built rough cabins along the river. The town of Kansas was formed in 1838 and a trail connecting the river landing to the Santa Fe Trail in the town of Westport was established.  Several years later, commercial buildings began popping up along the river bluffs</p><p>The era leading up to the Civil War was a tense and bloody time in Kansas City, as Missouri was a slave state and Kansas a free state. The Battle of Westport–one of bloodiest battles west of the Mississippi–took place in what today is Loose Park and Forest Hill Cemetery. With the Union prevailing, the city remained divided. Northerners preferred to live on the west side of Main Street on streets dubbed Pennsylvania, Broadway and Washington, and Southerners on the east side on streets such as Oak, Walnut and Locust. By 1870 a downtown street grid had been established.</p>

    <p>When a number of railways and the first bridge across the Missouri River were completed after the Civil War, the city’s population boomed. With the increased population came downtown development, and the wealthy built their mansion’s on Quality Hill.  The City Market at 4th and Walnut was the center of trade and where people to gathered to buy and sell goods, while the West Bottoms was the center of the burgeoning cattle industry, including stockyards, warehouses and packing houses.</p>

    <center><h3>Prosperity Comes to Town</h3></center>

    <p>The last decades of the 19th century were a time of prosperity that brought a building boom, resulting in a number of iconic Kansas City buildings, including the Board of Trade Building in 1888, the New York Life Building in 1890, Emery Bird Thayer building in 1890 and a Convention Hall in 1899.</p>
<p> Architectural firms in New York, Chicago and Boston established offices in Kansas City to take advantage of the construction boom. During this time Kansas City had more cable car routes than any other city except San Francisco and Chicago, shuttling people to and from popular areas including the Garment District at 9th and Walnut, Quality Hill, and Independence Avenue,where a number of wealthy business owners were building mansions.</p>
<p>The City Beautiful Movement, begun in 1884, led to George Kessler’s design of the parks and boulevards system by 1895.</p>

<p>In 1906 gave rise to several modern skyscrapers, including the R.A. Long building at 10th and Grand, the Scarritt Building at 8th and Grand, and Commerce Bank at 10th and Walnut. In 1907 electricity was celebrated with the opening of a grand amusement park called Electric Park at 47th and Paseo. In 1909 the City expanded as far south as 77th Street, resulting in many new houses, businesses, roads and boulevards.</p>
<p>That same year the Kansas City Zoo opened in Swope Park and the Boley Building designed by Louis Curtiss featured the first “curtain wall” design. With more room to stretch out, many working class citizens moved to residential neighborhoods primarily consisting of bungalows and simple four square houses that were accessible by the cable car.</p>
<p>For more wealthy residents, J.C. Nichols built the County Club District in the area south of Brush Creek, and was planning  shopping centers to serve these midtown residential neighborhoods.</p>
